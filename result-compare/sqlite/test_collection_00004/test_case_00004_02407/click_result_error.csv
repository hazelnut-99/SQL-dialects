 Code: 42. DB::Exception: ORDER BY or PRIMARY KEY clause is missing. Consider using extended storage definition syntax with ORDER BY or PRIMARY KEY clause. With deprecated old syntax (highly not recommended) storage SharedMergeTree requires 3 to 6 parameters: 
[path in [Zoo]Keeper],
[replica name],
name of column with date,
[sampling element of primary key],
primary key expression,
index granularity

Syntax for the MergeTree table engine:

CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]table_name [ON CLUSTER cluster]
(
    name1 [type1] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr1] [TTL expr1],
    name2 [type2] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr2] [TTL expr2],
    ...
    INDEX index_name1 expr1 TYPE type1(...) [GRANULARITY value1],
    INDEX index_name2 expr2 TYPE type2(...) [GRANULARITY value2]
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY expr
[PARTITION BY expr]
[PRIMARY KEY expr]
[SAMPLE BY expr]
[TTL expr [DELETE|TO DISK 'xxx'|TO VOLUME 'xxx'], ...]
[SETTINGS name=value, ...]
[COMMENT 'comment']

See details in documentation: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/. Other engines of the family support different syntax, see details in the corresponding documentation topics.
