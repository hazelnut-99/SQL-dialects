Syntax for the MergeTree table engine:

CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]table_name [ON CLUSTER cluster]
(
    name1 [type1] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr1] [TTL expr1],
    name2 [type2] [DEFAULT|MATERIALIZED|ALIAS expr2] [TTL expr2],
    ...
    INDEX index_name1 expr1 TYPE type1(...) [GRANULARITY value1],
    INDEX index_name2 expr2 TYPE type2(...) [GRANULARITY value2]
) ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY expr
[PARTITION BY expr]
[PRIMARY KEY expr]
[SAMPLE BY expr]
[TTL expr [DELETE|TO DISK 'xxx'|TO VOLUME 'xxx'], ...]
[SETTINGS name=value, ...]
[COMMENT 'comment']

See details in documentation: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree/. Other engines of the family support different syntax, see details in the corresponding documentation topics.

If you use the Replicated version of engines, see https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replication/.
